TARGET: get first-year.csv directly

1. Get Timetable Pdf            ->            STEP 3 (MAY BE DONE -> PROBABLY HERCULES HOSTS IT)
    i. write scraper to login erp
    ii. ask scraper to get timetable

2. Convert it into excel        ->            STEP 2 (ONGOING...DONE USING CAMALOT LIBRARY!!)
    i. write scraper to get smallpdf.com to convert from pdf to excel -> NOT A GOOD IDEA(NO POINT IN INSTALLING BROWSER IN SERVER)
    ii. research this: https://solidframework.net/ (mind behind smallpdf.com) -> DAMNN TOO EXPENSIVE ğŸ¤¯ğŸ¤¯ğŸ¤¯
    iii. ig handling manually is the best way to do this
    iv. got a better plan -> use camalot to scan the pdf to excel sheet, reuse the previous code

3. Formatting Excel             ->            STEP 1 (DONE!)
    i. Locate sheets with first year timetables :: LOCATE EAA IN SPECIFIC LOACTIONS (FIRST YEAR IS NOT WRITTEN IN ALL -> PARSING ERROR) -> DONE WITH NEW PARSER BY CAMELOT
    ii. sanitize sheets to remove heading so that all are equal :: GET Time/Day AT A1 FOR EASY PROCESSING OF NEXT STEP -> DELETE 2 ROWS FROM TOP AND 2 COLS FROM LEFT
    iii. get a map to connect times to slot number :: MANUAL GENERATION -> FOUND IN SLOTS.1 IN REPO -> WHILE MATCHING TRY MAX MATCH WITH ANY POSSIBLE SLOT IN THE WEEK
    iv. manipulate excel to get data with mapping slot->room :: LEARN ~PYEXCEL -> ACTUAL LIB NAME: OPENPYXL
    ---our location: we have map of slots->room->(subject name)---
    v. find api to get subject details from subject name of first years :: TRY GETTING ACCESS TO HERCULES -> NO NEED JUST MAP IT DIRECTLY, ONLY FEW POSSIBLE CASES -> MAPPED IN RESTRUCTURE.PY
    ---our location: we have map of slots->room->(subject with details)---
    vi. restructure data to get first_year.csv
